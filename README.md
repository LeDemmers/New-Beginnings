Death Alternative for Fallout 4 (PC)

# End-Goal
Create a Death Alternative mod that doesn't set the player as Essential and instead when player reaches X amount of HP plays a scene and sets the player character into a nearby owned settlement using the settlements fast travel marker. The player's items and equipped items are placed on a dead actor where the player had died.

I want to create a set of GlobalVariables that will allow the user to fine-tune their own experience of the Death Alternative.

Such as, if player dies and respawns at nearest owned settlement to remove a random non-essential/unique settler from the settlement to add immersive consequences.

	Items that settler had would be placed on the now respawning player character.

The corpse with the player's items would be left in place with all the player's items and equipment. Including quest items, if toggled.

	Other toggles would include, a percentage of inventory. Only armor, only weapons, only AID/AMMO, etc.

	A quest could be added to direct a player to their old body, can also be toggled off for players who would rather search for where their body flew off to in that explosion.
